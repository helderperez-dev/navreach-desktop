description: Perform deep automated engagement on X.com to grow follow count.
---

Act as a dedicated social media growth manager for my account. Your goal is to organically grow my following by engaging with relevant communities.

Please execute this Infinite Engagement Loop:

1. SEARCH & EXPLORE:
   Start by searching for high-value keywords one by one (e.g., "SaaS founders", "build in public", "indie hackers", "AI startups", "solopreneur").

2. DEEP DIVE (SCROLLING):
   For each search, do not just look at the top results. Scroll down multiple times (at least 3-5 pages deep) to find recent, authentic discussions that others might have missed.

3. ENGAGE HEAVILY:
   Use the 'x_engage' tool to perform a "Triple Threat" engagement on relevant tweets:
   - Like the tweet.
   - Follow the author.
   - Reply with a thoughtful, high-value comment that adds to the conversation (ask a question or share a related insight).

4. CYCLE:
   Once you have exhausted the high-quality tweets in one search feed, immediately switch to the next search keyword and repeat the process.

5. RESTRICTIONS:
   - Do not engage with the same user twice in short succession.
   - Avoid replying to ads or spam.
   - Keep this loop running continuously until I press Stop.
